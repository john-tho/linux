config TILE_HPI
	bool "Tilera hypervisor HPI interface support"
	default y
	depends on !TILEGX
	---help---
	  This device provides access to HPI devices, typically via
	  "mem", "int", and "info" devices in /dev/hpi/.

config TILE_RSHIM
	bool "Access to the Tile chip's rshim counters"
	default y
	---help---
	  This device provides access to the Tile chip's rshim
	  "down counters", a simple external counter API,
	  typically via /dev/rshim.

config TILE_EEPROM
	bool "Access to the I2C EEPROM memory"
	default y
	---help---
	  This device provides access to the I2C EEPROM memory,
	  typically via /dev/eeprom/0.

config TILE_MEMPROF
	bool "Memory profiling support in /proc/tile/memprof"
	default y
	---help---
	  This device provides real-time information on memory utilization,
	  latency, etc.

config TILE_BME_MEM
	bool "Bare-Metal Environment memory-sharing interface"
	default y
	---help---
	  This device allows sharing memory between a BME application
	  running on some of the cores and Linux on other cores,
	  typically via /dev/bme/mem.

config TILE_SOFTUART
	bool "Tilera Soft UART"
	default n
	depends on !TILEGX
	---help---
	  This device provides access to the FlexIO UART functionality.
	  It requires a dedicated hypervisor "softuart" driver tile.

config TILE_NETIO
	tristate "TILEPro GBE/XGBE/PCIe character device support"
	default y
	depends on HUGETLBFS && !TILEGX
	---help---
	  This is the low-level driver for access to xgbe/gbe.
	  This is not a network driver; see drivers/net/tile/ for that.
	  Instead, it is used for raw network frame access from userspace.
	  It can also provide raw frame access to PCIe.

config TILE_TMFIFO
	tristate "Character-device access to the Tilera tile-monitor FIFO"
	default y
	depends on TILEGX
	---help---
	  This device supports communication with an external controller
	  via the tile-monitor FIFO hardware.

config TILE_PKA
	tristate "Character-device access to the Tilera Public Key Accelerator"
	default y
	depends on TILEGX
	---help---
	  This device supports access to the hardware accelerator for
	  mathematical operations related to public key cryptography.
